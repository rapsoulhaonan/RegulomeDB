RegulomeDB is a database that annotates SNPs with known and predicted regulatory elements in the intergenic regions of the H. sapiens genome. 
Known and predicted regulatory DNA elements include regions of DNAase hypersensitivity, binding sites of transcription factors, and promoter regions that have been biochemically characterized to regulation transcription. 
Source of these data include public datasets from GEO, the ENCODE project, and published literature.
